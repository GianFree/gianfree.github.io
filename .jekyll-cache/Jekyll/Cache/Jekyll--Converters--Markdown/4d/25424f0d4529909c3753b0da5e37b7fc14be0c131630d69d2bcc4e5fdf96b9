<h2 id="all-atom-simulations">All-atom simulations</h2>

<p>Up to now, we saw a fair range of all-atoms simulations.
Each atom is treated like a point-like particle; if constraints are
used, we can set a 2 fs timestep.</p>

<p>With the help of a nice cluster, we can simulate a biological system
for a reasonable amount of time (hopefully up to microseconds).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s remind us the time-scale we are dealing with:</p>

<p><img class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/time_scale.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It would be nice to explore larger time scales and bigger systems.
One way to do it is to coarse grain our system.</p>

<h2 id="coarse-graining">Coarse graining</h2>
<p>A coarse-grained model is tool to simplify a system and study it
at a lower level of details. Some degrees of freedom are <em>integrated
out</em> and a group of atoms are represented by interaction sites:</p>

\[\textbf{R}_I = \textbf{M}_I(\textbf{r}) = \sum_i c_{Ii}\textbf{r}_i\]

<p>where \(\textbf{R}\) is the CG site, and \(\textbf{M}\) is the <em>mapping
function</em>.</p>

<p>The mapping can use a bottom-up or a top-down approach, can be modelled
on a particular system or can be transferable to others. The definition
of the interactions among sites is non trivial as well.</p>

<p>The aim of this page is not to treat the CG from a theoretical point of view. Several papers and books can be found on this topic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="shaken-not-stirred">Shaken, not stirred</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s use one of the resources to perform a coarse-grained
simulation: <a href="http://cgmartini.nl/"><strong>MARTINI</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="displayed" src="../../img/tut8/martini.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I know you all like alcohol, but the name is related to a tower in
Groningen, the Martini tower indeed, as an homage to the city in
which this forcefield has been developed.</p>

<p>Martini uses a top-down approach to model the sites (now referred as beads) and their interactions. It is developed to reproduce  structural
or thermodynamical properties, still preserving a chemical specificity
that allow the reproduction of experimental measurable quantities.</p>

<p>Initially, it was intended for lipids, then it was expanded to
proteins. The current version is 2.2, and a version 3.x is
currently in <a href="http://cgmartini.nl/images/parameters/martini3/beta/martini_3.0.b.3.2.tar.gz">open beta</a>.</p>

<h1 id="philosophy-behind">â€˜Philosophyâ€™ behind</h1>
<p>The Martini ff in based on a <strong>4 to 1</strong> correspondence of atoms to beads.</p>

<p>Here, you can find a schematic representation of how the change in
resolution is performed:
<img class="displayed" src="../../img/tut8/martini_bead.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Also water is coarse-grained: <strong>four</strong> water molecules are set to
<strong>one</strong> water bead.</p>

<p>Since the idea behind Martini is to be <em>system independent</em>,
the mapping is done on a residue base, so that it is <strong>transferable</strong>.</p>

<p>Each amino acid is represented by <u>one bead for the backbone</u>
and one or more for the sidechains.</p>

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Are all the CG residues defined in
this way?</p>

<p>Depending on the sidechains, the beads are divided into four classes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>charged: <strong>Q</strong>;</li>
  <li>polar: <strong>P</strong>;</li>
  <li>non polar: <strong>N</strong>;</li>
  <li>apolar: <strong>C</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These main classes have also subclasses to further differentiate the
residues.</p>

<p>Each bead has 72 or 45 atomic mass units, regardless of the actual
mass of the atoms they represent.</p>

<h1 id="force-field">Force field</h1>
<p>In Martini we have bonded interactions:</p>
<p align="center">
\(\begin{align*}
V_b  &amp; = \frac{1}{2} K_b (d_{ij}-d_b)^2\\
V_a  &amp; = \frac{1}{2} K_a \big[\cos(\phi_{ijk})-\cos(\phi_a)\big]^2\\
V_d  &amp; = K_d \big[1+\cos(\theta_{ijkl}-\theta_d)\big]\\
V_{id} &amp; = K_{id} (\theta_{ijkl} - \theta_{id})\\
\end{align*}\)
</p>

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Does it have the CHARMm functional form?</p>

<p>For the non-bonded interaction, the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential is
implemented and the electrostatic interaction with a dielectric
constant of \(\epsilon_{diel} = 15\).</p>

<p>With the decrease in the number of particles to be simulated it
comes the increase in the timestep that can be used.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, the timestep allowed by Martini is between
<strong>20</strong> to <strong>40 fs</strong>. The conservation of the total energy should
be checked for the different time steps (keep in mind that the
  energy conservation depends also on other parameters).</p>

<h1 id="application-and-limitations">Application and limitations</h1>
<p>The advantage of a CG represention, specifically for Martini,
can be employed to study several problems.
A review of such topics can be found in the â€˜Further notesâ€™ section.</p>

<p>The speed-up in computation and the broader range of systems you could
study are interesting features, but we need to remind ourselves that</p>
<p align="center"><u>From great power it comes greater responsabilities</u></p>
<p>or, like Ohmâ€™s oncle said:
<img class="displayed" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ohm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Therefore, limitations are to be taken into account.
We already saw that the backbone of each residue is represented
by a bead.</p>
<p class="prompt prompt-question">How would you represent alpha
 helices in this way?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>You need to enforce the secondary structure.</p>

<p>A more subtle problem is the freezing of water at \(290\pm5 K\) due
to the LJ 12-6 potential. So we need to add <strong>antifreezing</strong> water
molecules.
Due to this behaviour, systems that present water/air interfaces
cannot be studied.</p>
