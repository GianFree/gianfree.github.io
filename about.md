Hi, it's Gianfranco here!

I am a PhD in Computational Biophysics, a fancy name to say that I used
computers to investigate how proteins move and work.

"What is a protein?" you may ask. Well, in a nutshell a protein is a small
machine inside your body that allows you to walk, see and do everything you
do. You can have a brief intro to proteins, from a computational perspective,
in the `QCB` section. It was meant to be a practical section for a course at
the University of Trento. But if you have any question, you can contact me via
email ;).

As far as I am concerned, I developed an interest in programming during my
master's degree, and _a fortiori_ in my PhD years. Therefore, this is what you
will find in this blog:
- posts about programming, mainly from a scientific perspective;
- posts about interesting, at least for me, books (non-fiction!);
- what I would like to share!

Thanks for passing by, and
