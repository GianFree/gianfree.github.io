I have never liked writing. Essays, reports or, worst of all, fictional short stories for school. I have always liked doing exercises, about math, Latin or Italian grammar. It did not matter. But, of course, if you do something and you are not able to communicate your effort and works, nobody will ask you "Hey, J., what did you do this year? I'll write something about it for you!"
Therefore I had to do something to overcome my limits.

And here we are. Me, with a written blog. What an irony! Probably you are asking yourself: "Bah, this random guy... He just said he doesn't like writing, and he wants me to read his personal ranting?".

No, no, no.

The focus on this blog will be **programming** and **computation**: everything I find interesting to learn in the programming world, or phenomena funny to simulate computationally.

Am I a professional? Yes and no. I have a scientific background, a nice grasp on programming, but I would probably call myself an _amateur_, a craftsman. And to share what I like, do I really need to be a pro?
During the pandemic, I read [Show your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com)(AK). The book is easy to read, definitevely not rocket-science, but gave me a boost to communicate with people.
It reminded me that is okay to do mistakes, especially by amateurs,
and that you learn better if you are in a challenging and stimulating environment.

This blog is the starting point of this community. The main goal is to learn new stuff playfully, and to share it with whoever would like to join this path, with a sentence by AK bright in mind:
> When you find things you genuinely enjoy, don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it.

Writing will probably be my first passion, but I want to do something about it. And the only way to do something it to **start doing it**.

So, let's start!

#TanteCareCose and a Happy New Year! 🎉️🥂️
